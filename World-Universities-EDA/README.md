The goal of this project is to develop an interactive dashboard showing users different statistics with relation to Universities around the world and investigate certain aspects that contribute to the Universities global ranking.
This project utilizes that dataset from kaggle which if you'd like you can access [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raymondtoo/the-world-university-rankings-2016-2024?rvi=1](here).

Note that this is still a work in progress and I'd appreciate any feedback for improvement!

issues:
None at the moment


Some things I want to implement:
- Correlation plots between certain factors and the Universities ranking
- Schools with high gender disparity: Sequential Bar Chart showing Female to Male Ratio 
- Does high student:staff ratio contribute to poor teaching scores
