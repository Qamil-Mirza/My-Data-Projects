# My-Data-Projects
This is a compilation of some of the data science based projects that I will continually carry out to improve my technical skills and map my learning journey. Projects will range anywhere between Exploratory Data Analysis to ML/DL implementations.

I will start with these jupyter notebooks which I acknowledge the modularity isn't quite there. But the purpose of the first few projects is to get a refresher on machine learning in various fields. After that, I'll work on developing a deployable project which focuses on code readability and modularity!
