# My-Data-Projects
A compilation of my Data/AI projects as I learn and improve as an aspiring machine learning engineer. Feel free to take a look and if you have feedback for me, feel free to reach out to me at qamilmirza@gmail.com as I'd love to hear your thoughts. 


So I realized that I haven't been on my game when it came to documenting the projects, explaining the thought process and such. Once I'm done with midterms, I'll spend the weekend updating comments and markdown explanations for each project!
