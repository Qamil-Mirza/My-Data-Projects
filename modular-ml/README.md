# MNIST Number Classification - OOP Approach
In this project, I develop a model to classify numbers from the MNIST dataset. I've done this before multiple times but usually using a jupyter notebook which can admittedly get cluttered with code and markdown cells.

Hence, to ensure code modularity, I used instead an Object Oriented Approach in organising the my code. I'll explain each file below:

- main.py: Handles the main model training and evaluation process
- model.py: Used to build different classes for different Deep Learning Models
- utils.py: Used to load and preprocess data
